            <title>What is a policy?</title>

            <para>
                A policy applies a set of rules to traffic flowing between
                between zones (see zones (see <citerefentry>
                <refentrytitle>firewalld.zones</refentrytitle>
                <manvolnum>5</manvolnum> </citerefentry>). The policy affects
                traffic in a stateful unidirectional manner, e.g. zoneA to
                zoneB. This allows asynchronous filtering policies.
            </para>

            <para>
                A policy's relationship to zones is defined by assigning
                assigning a set set of ingress zones and a set of egress zones.
                For example, if the set of ingress zones "public" and the set
                of egress zones contains "internal" then the policy will affect
                all traffic flowing from the "public" zone to the "internal"
                zone. However, since policies are unidirectional it will not
                apply to traffic flowing from "internal" to "public". Note that
                the ingress set and egress set can contain multiple zones.

                        For non symbolic zones, the zone must be active. That

            <title>Symbolic Zones</title>
            <para>
                Regular zones are not enough to express every form of packet
                filtering. For example there is no zone to represent traffic
                flowing to or from the host running firewalld. As such, there
                are some symbolic zones to fill these gaps. However, symbolic
                zones are unique in that they're the only zone allowed in the
                ingress or egress zone sets. For example, you cannot use
                "public" and "HOST" in the ingress zones.

                        This symbolic zone is for traffic flowing to or from
                        the host running firewalld. This corresponds to
                        netfilter (iptables/nftables) chains INPUT and OUTPUT.

                        This symbolic zone behaves like a wildcard for the

                        does not include "HOST". It's useful if you want a
                        policy to apply to every zone.

                firewalld ships with some predefined policies. These may or may
                not be active by default. For details see the description of
                each policy.

        <refsect2 id="similaritiestozones">
            <title>Similarity to Zones</title>
            <para>
                Policies are similar to zones in that they are an attachment
                point for firewalld's primitives: services, ports, forward
                ports, etc. This is not a coincidence. Policies are a
                generalization of how zones have traditionally achieved
                filtering.  In fact, in modern firewalld zones are internally
                implemented as a set of policies.
            </para>
            <para>
                The main difference between policies and zones is that policies
                allow filtering in all directions: input, output, and
                forwarding. With a couple of exceptions zones only allow input
                filtering which is sufficient for an end station firewalling.
                However, for network level filtering or filtering on behalf of
                virtual machines and containers something more flexible, i.e.
                policies, are needed.
