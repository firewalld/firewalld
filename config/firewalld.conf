# firewalld config file

# default zone
# The default zone used if an empty zone string is used.
# Default: public
DefaultZone=public

# Clean up on exit
# If set to no or false the firewall configuration will not get cleaned up
# on exit or stop of firewalld.
# Default: yes
CleanupOnExit=yes

# Clean up kernel modules on exit
# If set to yes or true the firewall related kernel modules will be
# unloaded on exit or stop of firewalld. This might attempt to unload
# modules not originally loaded by firewalld.
# Default: no
CleanupModulesOnExit=no

# Lockdown
# If set to enabled, firewall changes with the D-Bus interface will be limited
# to applications that are listed in the lockdown whitelist.
# The lockdown whitelist file is lockdown-whitelist.xml
# The Lockdown feature is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
# Default: no
Lockdown=no

# IPv6_rpfilter
# Performs a reverse path filter test on a packet for IPv6. If a reply to the
# packet would be sent via the same interface that the packet arrived on, the
# packet will match and be accepted, otherwise dropped.
# The rp_filter for IPv4 is controlled using sysctl.
# Note: This feature has a performance impact. See man page FIREWALLD.CONF(5)
# for details.
# Default: yes
IPv6_rpfilter=yes

# IndividualCalls
# Do not use combined -restore calls, but individual calls. This increases the
# time that is needed to apply changes and to start the daemon, but is good for
# debugging.
# Default: no
IndividualCalls=no

# LogDenied
# Add logging rules right before reject and drop rules in the INPUT, FORWARD
# and OUTPUT chains for the default rules and also final reject and drop rules
# in zones. Possible values are: all, unicast, broadcast, multicast and off.
# Default: off
LogDenied=off

# LogDeniedGroup
# Configure whether to use LOG or NFLOG target for LogDenied. The default value
# is -1, which means that NFLOG is disabled and denials are logged to kernel
# log (dmesg(1)). Alternatively, by setting this to a number between 0 and
# 0xffff, the message is logged to the loaded logging backend.
# This is usually  used  in  combination  with nfnetlink_log as
# logging backend, which will multicast the packet through a netlink socket to
# the specified multicast group. One or more userspace processes may subscribe
# to the group to receive the packets.
# Use for example ulogd or tcpdump -i nflog:$GROUP to capture such logs.
# This has no effect with LogDenied=off.
LogDeniedGroup=-1

# FirewallBackend
# Selects the firewall backend implementation.
# Choices are:
#	- nftables (default)
#	- iptables (iptables, ip6tables, ebtables and ipset)
# Note: The iptables backend is deprecated. It will be removed in a future
# release.
FirewallBackend=nftables

# FlushAllOnReload
# Flush all runtime rules on a reload. In previous releases some runtime
# configuration was retained during a reload, namely; interface to zone
# assignment, and direct rules. This was confusing to users. To get the old
# behavior set this to "no".
# Default: yes
FlushAllOnReload=yes

# ReloadPolicy
# Policy during reload. By default all traffic except for established
# connections is dropped while the rules are updated. Set to "DROP", "REJECT"
# or "ACCEPT". Alternatively, specify it per table, like
# "OUTPUT:ACCEPT,INPUT:DROP,FORWARD:REJECT".
# Default: ReloadPolicy=INPUT:DROP,FORWARD:DROP,OUTPUT:DROP
ReloadPolicy=INPUT:DROP,FORWARD:DROP,OUTPUT:DROP

# RFC3964_IPv4
# As per RFC 3964, filter IPv6 traffic with 6to4 destination addresses that
# correspond to IPv4 addresses that should not be routed over the public
# internet.
# Defaults to "yes".
RFC3964_IPv4=yes

# NftablesFlowtable
# This may improve forwarded traffic throughput by enabling nftables flowtable.
# It is a software fastpath and avoids calling nftables rule evaluation for
# data packets. This only works for TCP and UDP traffic.
# The value is a space separated list of interfaces.
# Example value "eth0 eth1".
# Defaults to "off".
NftablesFlowtable=off

# NftablesCounters
# If set to yes, add a counter to every nftables rule. This is useful for
# debugging and comes with a small performance cost.
# Defaults to "no".
NftablesCounters=no
