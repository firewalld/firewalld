  <description>
    Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) allows both IPv4 and IPv6
    hosts to perform name resolution for hosts on the same local network. This
    service allows incoming LLMNR responses. Due to protocol details the
    service matches by source port and thus allows unsolicited responses.
