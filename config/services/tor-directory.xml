  <short>Tor - Directory</short>
  <description>Tor enables online anonymity and censorship resistance by directing Internet traffic through a network of relays. It conceals user's location from anyone conducting network surveillance and traffic analysis. If you open your DirPort, then Tor clients will ask you for a copy of the directory.</description>
