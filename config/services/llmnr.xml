    Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) allows both IPv4 and IPv6
    hosts to perform name resolution for hosts on the same local network. This
    service matches incoming queries; it will allow this host to be resolved
    by other hosts. In order to allow this host to resolve other hosts, use
    the llmnr-client service.
