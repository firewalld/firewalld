  <short>Tor - Browser Bundle</short>
  <description>Tor enables online anonymity and censorship resistance by directing Internet traffic through a network of relays. It conceals user's location from anyone conducting network surveillance and traffic analysis. Tor Browser Bundle uses this port as SOCKS proxy port. It is recommended that you make this service available only for your computer or your internal networks.</description>
